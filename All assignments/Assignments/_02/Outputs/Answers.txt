Exercise 2.01 (b):

Exercise 2.01 (c):
In total, the needed amount of points would be 8, 4 from the ground floor and the map.
The reason for this, is that a homography got a DOF (Degree of freedom) of 8.
Therefore the amount of corresponding points needed is 4 at a minimum.

Exercise 2.01 (g):
The reason is that the camera is standing still while recording. The corresponding points
would stay the same, even thought the image in the image sequence changes.

Exercise 2.01 (h):
This will result in a wrong mapping. As the ground floor and overview map are being moved relative
to each other, the corresponding points would change and therefore the homography doesn't apply to
the new corresponding points. It will be required to calculate a new homography.

Exercise 2.03 (b):
The texture mapping fails because of the parallel lines between the squares gets
blurry when a slight movement of the chessboard happens. It also fails whenever
multiple squares and their outline doesn't line up (are parallel).
